# Day 01 — Python Basics: Variables, Data Types & Printing

- **Date:** 2025-08-11
- **Topic:** Introduction to Python basics — variables, data types, and print function.

## Summary
Today marks the start of the 100 Days of Python for Algorithmic Trading journey.  
I revised the fundamentals of Python including how to:
- Create variables
- Work with basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Output data using `print()`

These are the building blocks that every trading algorithm will rely on, so having a solid foundation is essential.

## What I Learned
- Declaring and assigning variables in Python
- Understanding different data types and type checking with `type()`
- Basic string formatting
- Difference between integers and floats
- Printing multiple values in a single statement
